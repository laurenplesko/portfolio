		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Dedicated and enthusiastic young professional who is highly skilled in communication, conflict resolution, team leadership, and ArcGIS products.  As a recent graduate with sturdy roots in Environmental Geography, Sociology, and GIS, I am looking to leverage my technical knowledge and analytical skills into a meaningful role.  
			<br>
			<br>
		I see great value in using GIS to support environmental conservation and efforts to facilitate the equitable and allocation of social and community supports, and I am eager to channel this passion into my daily work to make a positive difference in the lives of those around me.</p>
